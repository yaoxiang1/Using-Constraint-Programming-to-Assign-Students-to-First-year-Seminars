Using-Constraint-Programming-to-Assign-Students-to-First-year-Seminars
======================================================================

Abstract  
Many colleges or universities in the United States have First-Year Seminars. For the  incoming students, First-Year Seminar 
is designed to introduce students to the liberal art  education and encourages students to participate the classroom discussion. 
Therefore, it is  important to achieve a balance between student genders and origins. Also, in Dickinson  College, each student 
can have 6 options indicating the rankings for their seminar choices.  The college should satisfy students by choosing seminars 
they prefer. In this research, we  use constraint programming to develop the program to solve the course assignment  problem and 
also achieve a better balance between student groups as well as giving  students their preferred course choices.
